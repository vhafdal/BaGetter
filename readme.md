## 🚀 Getting Started

With Docker:

1. `docker run -p 5000:8080 -v ./bagetter-data:/data bagetter/bagetter:latest`
2. Browse `http://localhost:5000/` in your browser

With .NET:

1. Install the [.NET SDK]
2. Download and extract [BaGetter's latest release]
3. Start the service with `dotnet BaGetter.dll`
4. Browse `http://localhost:5000/` in your browser

With IIS ([official microsoft documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/host-and-deploy/iis)):

1. Install the [hosting bundle](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/permalink/dotnetcore-current-windows-runtime-bundle-installer)
2. Publish the host project (`src/BaGetter`), not `src/BaGetter.Web`:
   - `dotnet publish src/BaGetter/BaGetter.csproj -c Release -p:PublishProfile=FolderProfile`
3. Deploy the `src/BaGetter/bin/Release/net10.0/publish/` folder to your server
4. Ensure your IIS site's physical path points to the publish folder
5. Confirm `web.config` exists in the publish output. If you only see `bin/Release/net10.0/` and not `publish/`, you likely built instead of published.

You can also use the helper script from the repository root:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/Publish-IIS.ps1
```

For more information, please refer to the [documentation].
