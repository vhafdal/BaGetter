BaGetter supports Filesystem, GCP and AWS S3 buckets, and Azure Blob Storage for package storage, and MySQL, Sqlite, SqlServer and PostgreSQL as database. The current per-package size limit is ~8GB. It can be hosted on IIS, and is also available in a linux [docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/bagetter/bagetter).
It also supports paged NuGet registration metadata responses to improve performance for packages with large version histories.
